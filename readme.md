## About The Project

There are many great Game Engine available on the web, but, for create very small project I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a Game Engine so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* I want learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a game engine from scratch
* You want the lowest code abstraction !!
